# species-climate-index
R-script to calculate climate parameter indices for species based on their distribution.

Run climate_parameter_index() with the decimal latitude and longitude of the species occurrence data and a 43200x21600 raster file such as the WorldClim 30s rasters.
Run gbif_climate_parameter_index() with the GBIF taxonKeys and 43200x21600 raster files such as the WorldClim 30s rasters.
